Laboratory: Linux and Emacs scavenger hunt

1. command: man -k keyword 
I used the command "man man"
and then read the manual man page (especially for the description part)
to find this command: man -k keyword, 
where keyword is the specific word we need to search for.

2. command: which cp
	    which wc
It can use which command or whereis command to locate the program.
I used which command and find that:
cp /usr/local/cs/bin/cp
wc /usr/local/cs/bin/wc 

3. Firstly, I used the command: find /usr/bin/ -name '?'
I found the following:
/usr/bin/X
/usr/bin/w
/usr/bin/[
Then I used the following command to figure out what they do:
man X
man w
man [
man bash
I got the following results:
X: a portable, network-transparent window system
w: show who is logged on and what they are doing
[: for conditional evaluation (a bash built-in command)

4. Firstly I used the command: man -k symbolic
Then I read all the commands that have the word "symbolic" in the description.
I found the command: readlink /usr/bin/emacs
It shows that the file is: /etc/alternatives/emacs

5. Firstly I used the command: man chmod
Then I read the page to get the meaning of '+', '-', 'g', 's', 'o', 'x'.
+: add the selected file mode bits
-: remove the selected file mode bits
g: the permissions granted to other users who are members of the file's group
s: set user or group ID on execution
o: other users not in the file's group
x: execute (or search for directories)
Therefore,
g+s: set the group ID on execution
(newly created files in the current directory get the directory's group ID)
o-x: remove the permission of other users not in the file's group to execute

6. I used the command "man find" to find the answer.
The option to find for the required search is: -mtime -21
(21 means 21*24 hours, in other words, three weeks)

7. I used the command "man find" and read the manual page.
Then I figured out that the command should be: find -mtime -21 -type d
And it then gave the following output:
.
./Documents
./.cache/abrt
./.emacs.d
./.emacs.d/auto-save-list

8. I searched for the command by reading the manual page (man find).
I firstly got into the directory: cd /usr/bin
I typed the command: find -type l
It gave the following output:

In total, there are 293 symbolic links.

9. I used the command "man ls" to find the command.
I firstly got into the directory: cd /usr/lib
Then I used the command: ls -lt
I found the oldest regular file as follows:
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root root   18692 Jan 26  2014 libgpg-error.so.0.10.0

10. I used the command "man locale" and "man localedef" to find the answer.
The current locale settings are based on:
the setting of the environment variables that control the locale.
So it gets its data from the environment variables.
Also, localedef compiles locale definition files, locale can get data from it.

11. I used the following commands:
emacs
C-h a sort
C-x o
And I found the following commands that have sort in their name:
Buffer-menu-sort
sort-columns
sort-fields
sort-lines
sort-numeric-fields
sort-pages
sort-paragraphs
sort-regexp-fields
tabulated-list-col-sort
tabulated-list-sort

12. emacs
I used the command: C-h k and then typed the command we need to search.
C-M-a: Move backward to the beginning of a defun.
C-M-b: Move backward across one balanced expression (sexp).
C-M-c: Exit from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer.
C-M-d: Move forward down one level of parentheses.
C-M-e: Move forward to next end of defun.
C-M-f: Move forward across one balanced expression (sexp).
C-M-g: undefined
C-M-h: Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning.

13. emacs
I used the command: C-h k and then typed the command: C-g
Then I typed C-x o and I found that:
C-g runs the command keyboard-quit (found in global-map), which is an
interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’.
Basically, C-g signals a ‘quit’ condition.
During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
Additionally, at top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.

14. emacs
I used the command: C-h f and then typed "yank".
I found the following:
(yank is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’.
It is bound to C-y, <S-insertchar>, <S-insert>, <menu-bar> <edit> <paste>.)
This function mainly reinserts ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.

15. command: ls -1
	     emacs
	     C-x d
	     C-x C-c
By comparing the results, I found that: 
Emacs dired command also shows the files beginning with ".", ".."
But "ls -1" does not show these files.
Also, dired command displays more detailed information for the files.
(such as the date, etc.)
