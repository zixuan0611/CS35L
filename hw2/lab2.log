A lab notebook: Spell-checking Hawaiian

1. I firstly used the following command to ensure that the shell command
locale outputs LC_CTYPE="C" or LC_CTYPE="POSIX":
   export LC_ALL='C'

2. Then I sorted the contents of the file /usr/share/dict/words:
   sort -u -o words /usr/share/dict/words

3. I got a text file containing the HTML in the assignment's web page:
   wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter18/cs35L/assign/assign2.html
   cp assign2.html assign2.txt

4. Then I ran the following commands as required:
   tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt
We can see that this outputs words that contain A-Z or a-z along with
lots of empty lines. This is because that we use the tr command with the
-c option. It complements the set of upper case and lower case letters and
replaces others that does not have such characters with newline characters.

   tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt
We can see that instead of a bunch of empty lines, this only displays one
empty line along with the words that contain A-Z or a-z. This is because that
we use the tr command with the -cs option. Besides the complement, it also
squeezes multiple occurrences of newline characters.

   tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt | sort
We can see that in addition, the output is sorted in the order of A-Z and a-z.
This is because we use the tr command along with sort.

   tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt | sort -u
We can see that it not only outputs words in sorted order but also deletes
duplicate words. This is because that we use the sort command with the -u
option. It will suppress all but one in each set of lines having equal keys.
So it makes every word "unique".

   tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt | sort -u | comm - words
We can see that it outputs three columns of words. The first column lists
the words that only exist in "assign2.txt". (which are the words produced by
the previous command.) The second column lists the words that only exist in
the file "words". The third column lists the words that exist in both files.
This is because we use the comm command to compare the words in the two files.

   tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt | sort -u | comm -23 - words
We can see that this outputs only the first column of the results produced
by the previous command. (the words that only exist in "assign2.txt".) This
is because we use the -23 option. It removes the second and third columns of
the output by the previous command.

5. I obtained the copy of the web page "English to Hawaiian":
wget http://mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdseng.htm

6. I built the srcipt.
   #!/bin/bash

   extract lines which contain words (between <td> and </td>):
   grep '<td>.*</td>' |

   remove all the "\":
   sed 's/\///g' |

   remove all the "<td>":
   sed 's/<td>//g' |

   remove all HTML tags:
   sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' |

   remove leading space:
   sed 's/^\s*//g' |

   remove empty lines:
   sed '/^$/d' |

   get lines with Hawaiian words (extract even numbered lines):
   awk 'NR % 2 == 0' |

   remove all <u>:
   sed 's/<u>//g' |

   treat all upper case letters as lower case letters:
   tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' |

   replace ` with ':
   sed s/\`/\'/g |
   
   replace space with newline characters:
   sed 's/ /\n/g' |

   remove all commas:
   sed 's/,//g' |

   remove improperly formatted words:
   sed '/-/d' |

   remove entries which contain non-Hawaiian letters:
   tr -cs "pk\'mnwlhaeiou" '[\n*]' |
   
   remove empty lines:
   sed '/^$/d' |

   sort unique:
   sort -u

7. I gave permission to execute the file:
   chmod +x buildwords

8. I made the Hawaiian dictionary called "hwords":
   cat hwnwdseng.htm | ./buildwords > hwords

9. Count the number of misspelled English:
   cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | 
   sort -u | comm -23 - words > misspelledEng

   I opened the file "misspelledEng" and found that the number of "misspelled"
   English is 38.

10. Count the number of misspelled Hawaiian:
    cat assign2.html | tr -cs "pk\'mnwlhaeiou" '[\n*]' | 
    tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort -u | comm -23 - hwords > misspelledHaw

    I opened the file "misspelledHaw" and found that the number of "misspelled"
    Hawaiian is 198.

11. I looked for any words that are "misspelled" as English, 
    but not as Hawaiian:
    cat misspelledEng | tr -cs "pk\'mnwlhaeiou" '[\n*]' |
    sort -u | comm -12 - hwords > check1 

    Examples are as follows:
    e
    halau
    i
    lau
    po
    wiki

12. I looked for any words that are "misspelled" as Hawaiian, 
    but not as English:
    cat misspelledHaw | tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | 
    sort -u | comm -12 - words > check2
